# About me ðŸ‘‹


**StisionGamer/StisionGamer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on modding games ðŸŽ®
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic Git for modding
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various Bethesda titles
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Marvel, Star Wars, or any variety of other geeky subjects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I think GitHub has a messaging feature? I'd think they would at least.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy non-competitive sports ðŸª¨
